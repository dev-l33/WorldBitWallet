</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>(a). Encourage and facilitate the depositing and receipt of merchandise with the Vendor, and for transactions to be brokered within the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem;</li>

Usage of the Tokens is subject to limitations and conditions in these Terms of Sale, and any other applicable terms and policies as determined by the Vendor and as amended from time to time, which govern any use of Tokens in connection with interacting with the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem.<strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> </strong></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
 	<li><strong>PURCHASE AND DELIVERY OF THE TOKENS</strong><strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> </strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li>2.1 The sale period for the Tokens shall be: Nov 11, 2017 to Jan 31, 2018 (the “<strong>Sale Period</strong>”).<strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>2.2 Your purchase of Tokens from us during the Sale Period is irrevocable, non-redeemable, and non-repurchaseable by the Vendor, and there shall be no refunds or cancellations, except as required by applicable law or regulation or paragraph 2.3 below. You shall not under any circumstances receive money or any other form of compensation for any Tokens purchased.<strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>2.3 The Vendor may determine, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to obtain certain information about you in order to comply with applicable law or regulation in connection with selling Tokens to you. You agree to provide us such information promptly upon request, and you acknowledge that the Vendor may, at its sole discretion, elect to revoke the Sale if (i) you refuse to provide such requested information or (ii) after receipt of the requested information, the Vendor is of the view that the Sale may not be in compliance with any applicable law or regulation. In such event, and upon the return of all the cryptocurrencies making up the relevant purchase amount (less all applicable transaction fees) to the Return Wallets (as defined in Paragraph 2.4 below) of the Purchaser, the Vendor shall have no further obligation or liability to the Purchaser under these Terms of Sale.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>2.4 To be able to purchase Tokens using supported cryptocurrencies during the Sale Period, Purchasers must have full operational access to valid digital wallets in the applicable cryptocurrency, such as Ether or Bitcoin (“<strong>Paying Wallet</strong>”). The Vendor will also require the Purchaser to submit information about the address of digital return wallets (“<strong>Return Wallets</strong>”) in order to facilitate a return of cryptocurrencies as contemplated in Paragraph 2.3 above, or for any other reason as contemplated in these Terms of Sale. Purchasers are also required to have full operational access to an ERC20 token standard Ethereum wallet in order to receive Tokens from the Vendor via the Vendor’s Smart Contract System (“<strong>Receiving Wallet</strong>”).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>2.5 The number of Tokens you wish to purchase shall be stated by you through the electronic form provided by us at (url). Upon your submission of the electronic form, the Vendor shall then send you a unique deposit address for Bitcoin or Ether (depending on the address you provided for the Paying Wallet). Once the unique deposit address has received Bitcoin or Ether from you, Vendor will authorize the Smart Contract System to deliver Tokens to the Receiving Wallet that you provided to Vendor for delivery of the Tokens.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>2.6 Your submission of the electronic form shall be deemed as an offer by you to purchase the Tokens (“<strong>Offer</strong>”). The Offer shall not be revocable for a period of [x] (refer to paragraph 2.9 below) working days from the date of the Offer. The Offer is accepted upon the Vendor’s delivery of Tokens to the Receiving Wallet (“<strong>Acceptance</strong>”). Parties agree to accept and be bound by these Terms of Sales upon the Acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>2.7 You are responsible for implementing reasonable measures for securing the Receiving Wallet, vault or other storage mechanism you use to receive and hold the Tokens you purchase from us, including any requisite private key(s) or other credentials necessary to access such storage mechanism(s). If your private key(s) or other access credentials are lost, you may lose access to your Tokens. We are not responsible for any such losses.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>2.8 The Vendor reserves the right to prescribe additional guidance, instructions and terms regarding specific wallet requirements as set out in its website at (url) at the time of the Sale, which you agree to adhere to. The Vendor may also request certain optional information, such as an email address, through its web interface.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>2.9 The Vendor anticipates that delivery of Tokens from the Smart Contract System to the Purchasers will occur within [time frame] after the relevant payment has been verified, but reserves the right to delay delivery up to [time frame] after the said verification. Although the Vendor does not anticipate any major delays relating to the delivery of the Tokens, this extended timeframe is intended as a precautionary buffer period for the Vendor to conduct its due diligence checks and verifications on the Purchasers, for the purpose of compliance with Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism regulations.</li>
</ul>
<strong>SCHEDULE B | </strong>RISKS &amp; DISCLAMERS
By purchasing the Tokens, you expressly acknowledge, accept, understand and agree to assume the following risks and disclaimers pertaining to the Tokens:
<ul>
 	<li>1.1 The Tokens are sold on an "as is" and "as available" basis and the Vendor expressly disclaims all implied warranties as to the same, including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for any particular purpose, title and non- infringement.<strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>1.2 The Tokens are designed for very specific use with respect to certain virtual ecosystems and should not be treated as being merchantable and do not necessarily have any other use or value. There should be no specific outlook or expectation on the merchantability or market price of the Tokens and the purchase of Tokens is therefore not subject to protections of any kind afforded by securities laws in the Purchaser's home jurisdiction or in any other jurisdiction.<strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>1.3 The Tokens are not intended to be or function under any circumstances as any form of security, commodity or any other kind of financial instrument, including but not limited to:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>(a) a security or representing any equity or ownership interest in the Vendor or any other entity in any jurisdiction;</li>
 	<li>(b) a debt or liability of any nature owed by the Vendor to the Purchaser or any other entity;</li>
 	<li>(c) any form of financial derivative including, but not limited to, a futures contract, forward contract, option, swap or warrant;</li>
 	<li>(d) a contract for difference of any form or kind or any other contract, the purpose of which is to secure a profit or avoid a loss by reference to fluctuations in the value or price of an asset or an index;</li>
 	<li>(e) any commercial paper or negotiable instrument;</li>
 	<li>(f) any commodity or asset that any person is obliged to redeem or purchase;</li>
 	<li>(g) any note, bond, warrant or other certificate that entitles the Purchaser to repayment of the Purchase Price, any interest, dividend or any other kind of return on the Purchase Price by the Vendor or any other entity;</li>
 	<li>(h) giving the Purchaser rights of any form with respect to the Vendor or its profits, revenues or assets (both current and future), including, but not limited to, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property), or other financial or legal rights (including but not limited to fiduciary duties); or</li>
 	<li>(i) an interest or share in any investment fund or collective investment scheme;</li>
 	<li>(j) the pooling of monies with the aim of spreading investment risk; and/or</li>
 	<li>(k) entitling the Purchaser to participate in any profits or gains from the acquisition, holding management or disposal of assets.</li>
 	<li>1.4 The Vendor expressly disclaims any liabilities whatsoever to the Purchaser, and shall not be liable to the Purchaser for any loss, damage or delay caused by, arising from, or in respect of the following:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><u>(a) Private Key(s) May be Compromised.</u> Private access keys or a combination thereof are necessary to retain access to and control over any Tokens you have stored in your digital wallet(s). In the event that these keys are lost, stolen or hacked by a third party, or if the service provider gets compromised, you may lose all of the Tokens you have stored with little to no avenue of recourse. The Vendor assumes no liability to the Purchaser in such situations.</li>
 	<li><u>(b) The Ethereum Protocol</u><strong><em>.</em></strong> Any failure, dysfunction, destruction, or desertion of the Ethereum protocol is beyond the control of the Vendor and may have a material adverse effect on the Tokens and/or the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem, which is being built upon it. Other technological developments and advancements in areas such as blockchain technology, cryptography, or quantum computing may also render the Etheruem Protocol obsolete. These also represent existential risks to the Tokens and the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem.</li>
 	<li><u>(c) Delays in Delivery.</u> Due to the nature of the blockchain technology being used for cryptocurrencies, the Purchaser may not receive the Tokens on the same day that the purchase price is paid, and the blockchain may also be prone to periodic congestion during which the Purchaser’s transactions may be delayed or lost.</li>
 	<li><u>(d) Resource Volatility. </u>The Vendor remains vulnerable to price fluctuations of the resources used to fund the development of the Token and the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem. Such resources are derived from the sale of the Tokens, among other sources, and include Ether, Bitcoin, other related cryptocurrencies as applicable, and fiat currency. The ongoing development and maintenance of the Vendors’ technologies and infrastructure may be adversely affected, delayed or suspended by such unpredictability.</li>
 	<li><u>(e) Mining Attacks.</u> The accurate lodgement and recording of transactions on the Ethereum protocols depends greatly on the process of distributed verification by miners. This process of validation is vulnerable to many known exploits which may impair or affect the ability of the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem and the Tokens to function.</li>
 	<li><u>(f) Cybercrime and Security Failure. </u>The Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem and/or the Tokens remain susceptible to malicious cyberattacks by autonomous software or hackers, and other illegal cyber activities. Such attacks could include, among others, phishing, malware attacks, distributed denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. The internal security of the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem’s core infrastructure may also be compromised by external agents or the employees, agents and affiliates of the Vendor, which could debilitate the functioning of Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem and the Tokens.</li>
 	<li><u>(g) Secondary Markets. </u>There are no secondary markets for the trading of the Tokens that are being supported by the Vendor. In absence of any valuation system, the Tokens may have little to no value outside of the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem, or they may be subject to lack of demand or volatile price fluctuations, leading to illiquidity. Further, many secondary third party exchanges function with little supervision from the relevant authorities, heightening the risk of failure, fraud, theft, or manipulation.</li>
 	<li><u>(h) Vendor or Ecosystem may be Dissolved.</u> Due to any number of uncertainties in the cryptocurrency industry, including but not limited to resource volatility, business failure, government regulations, lack of technological development, or any other unforeseen circumstances, the Vendor or the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem may be rendered non-viable and dissolved without notice.</li>
 	<li><u>(i) Development of Ecosystem. </u>The Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem has not been finalised for deployment and remains subject to review, changes, and further research and development. There are no guarantees that the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem and the Tokens will function as intended or if they will function at all. Circumstances may arise which call for the entire ecosystem to be revamped, for the characteristics of the Tokens to be redefined in any number of ways, or any combination thereof. Further, the Worldbit Commercial System remains vulnerable to systemic failure, unidentifiable malfunction, and lack of skill or resources for proper maintenance and/or further development.</li>
 	<li>(j) Alternative Ecosystems. The establishment of other commercial ecosystems which offer products, services or solutions identical or superior to the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem, or which utilise the same underlying protocol, may result in competition. In such event, and where the Vendor is unable to compete for any reason, the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem and the Tokens may suffer failure.</li>
 	<li><u>(k) Cloud Storage. </u>The Vendor may utilise cloud storage solutions for any of its operational and commercial needs. Such systems are vulnerable to the accompanying risks of information decentralization, including but not limited to breach of storage security, service interruption, cyberattacks, loss of assets, and suspension of access. The Vendor may irretrievably lose large amounts of important data, rendering it unable to function temporarily or permanently. Among other negative consequences, this may result in the indefinite disruption or suspension of access to and usage of the Tokens and the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem.</li>
 	<li><u>(l) Governance Rights. </u>The Purchaser is not afforded any voting or corporate governance rights by purchasing the Tokens. Therefore, it will have no right to participate in any aspect of corporate decision-making by the Vendor. Actions affecting the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem and the Tokens may be executed by the Vendor without reference to, or approval from the Purchasers.</li>
 	<li><u>(m) Lack of Critical Mass.</u> The Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem depends on adoption and participation by a critical mass of users in order to be functional and commercially viable. In the event that there are insufficient users over a prolonged period of time, the functionality of the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem and the potential utility of Tokens may be diminished or rendered commercially non-viable.</li>
 	<li><u>(n) Regulatory Impacts</u>. The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, including the Tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. In the event that any governmental authority make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules or financial institutions make commercial decisions and such changes/decisions negatively impact the Tokens in various ways, the Vendor shall be entitled to cease the distribution and maintenance of the Tokens, or cease operations in any jurisdiction without incurring any liability whatsoever to the Purchaser.</li>
 	<li><u>(o) Intervention</u>. The industry in which the Vendor operates is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not examine the operations of the Vendor and/or pursue enforcement actions against the Vendor. The Vendor may be subject to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Vendor to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm the Vendor’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the Tokens and/or impair the ability of the Vendor to perform its obligations under this Agreement. In such event, the Vendor shall not be held liable for any losses suffered by the Purchaser.</li>
 	<li><u>(p) Reliance on Third Parties.</u> The Vendor may rely on other third parties, in whole or in part, to implement the sale, development or supply of the Tokens, and there is no assurance or guarantee that said third parties will be competent, complete their work for the Vendor, properly carry out their obligations, or otherwise meet any Party’s needs, all of which might have a material adverse effect on the Vendor’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.</li>
 	<li><u>(q) Other Unforeseen Threats.</u> Much of the cryptographic token industry remains unchartered and untested. Hence there may be a variety of unforeseen and unanticipated risks associated with the Tokens and the Worldbit Commercial Ecosystem which are not explicitly addressed herein. Such risks may materialise at any point before or after the Purchaser acquires or uses the Tokens.</li>
 	<li>1.5 The Vendor retains all rights, title and interests in all of Vendor’s intellectual property (whether registrable or not), including, without limitation, inventions, ideas, concepts, code, discoveries, processes, marks, methods, software, compositions, formulae, techniques, information and data, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or protectable in trademark, and any trademarks, copyright or patents based thereon. The Purchaser may not use any of Vendor’s intellectual property for any reason whatsoever.</li>
